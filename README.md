3. Ensure you have Lua installed on your system.


## About the src Folders

- **src/fundamentals**: Contains Lua scripts and examples covering basic language concepts, syntax, and standard library usage. Great for learning and reference.

- **src/lua**: General-purpose Lua scripts and utilities. Includes the main entry point (`main.lua`) and reusable helpers for scripting and experimentation.

- **src/love-2d**: A template for LÖVE2D game projects. Provides a structured starting point with a comprehensive `utils/utils.lua` module and documentation for common LÖVE modules.

## Usage
To run the main application, execute `src/lua/main.lua`.
You can add your own Lua scripts in the `src` directory and test them in the playground.
